# Fast Remote Matplotlib

FastRemoteMatplotlib (or FRM) presents a POC of a real proxy method to use Matplotlib without a Forward X server (which is pretty damn slow). 

## Why ?  

When researching how to put together a set of tools for working on a remote machine, I realized that using matplotlib (without a web alternative) is almost impossible. 
The only manear to proceed is to use the X forward which is very slow [1]. Despite the need from the community [2], no alternative is currently availiable.

I took the initiative to create a possible alternative to the X forward method.
Even if my goad is to provide something as complet as possible, the help from matplotlib devlopers will be mandatory to reach a stable and reliable version of this.

If you have the need to a fast remote method for matplotlib, I encourage you to give it a try. Hopefully,  it will meet all your expectations.
